		<p><h3>I am an industrious, seasoned and well-rounded business professional who loves innovation, tech and start-ups. I have 15 years experience in consulting and project management with an industry focus on real estate.

		I started my career at E&Y in Washington, DC and New York. After a decade at E&Y, including a short stint in Bangalore (India) I moved on to <a href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> where I was responsible for developing a $200m+ off-campus residential portfolio. 

		My focus within real estate is real estate development and public-private partnerships (for example - I worked on The Yards in DC). Real estate development allows me to leverage my backgrounds in architecture, design, real estate and business. I love public-private partnerships because of their double bottom line - profit and mission.
